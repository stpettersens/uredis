### uredis
> Redis compatible server and client implemented in Python using only the standard library.

Latest version is v0.1.0 and the following commands are implemented:

* HELLO
* CLIENT 
* PING
* ECHO
* SET
* GET
* TTL
* DEL
* FLUSHDB
* FLUSHALL
* KEYS

The only data type supported so far is strings, but this version
is good enough to run my http://ip-locator.xyz application on FreeBSD.
